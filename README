                                                 Vetsco (Verilog To Spice Converter)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vetsco is a tool that converts a structural Verilog netlist into a Spice netlist using the LibNanGate45nm library and does simulations
using ngspice in the background. The tool plots the power of the circuit and the voltages of the input, outputs of the circuit. 
Be aware:
-To use this tool Ngspice has to be downloaded since the simulations are done on there.
-The netlist must be written with the gates provided in LibNanGate45nm.
-The input and outputs must be one bit (for now)
-For verilog only structural version must be used. (for now)
-To open the project QTCreator must be used since UI is designed with QTCreator.
